#============================================================================
# The state machine is composed of three different classes.
#
#  1. StateMachine - This is the class that executes and configures
#     the states and transitions. A state machine contains a list of states.
#
#  2. State - This class implements a state consisting of it's execution
#     logic and it's list of transitions. When the machine executes a state,
#     it's logic is executed and all of its transitions are evaluated.
#     The first transition to evaluate to True is used by the machine
#     to determine its next state. A state contains a list of transitions.
#     During execution of a state logic, a flag called execute_once is True
#     during the first execution of a state logic. This is very useful to
#     run a logic only once when the state is first active. The remaining
#     logic other than the one in the execute_once block is executed continously
#     until a transition returns True.
#
#         def state1_logic():
#             global counter
#             
#             if myMachine.execute_once:
#                 myTimer.start()                       }   
#                 counter += 1                          }   Code that executes only the first time the state is active. 
#                 print("State 1 Logic: Blinking LED")  }
#
#             do_something()                            }   Call do_something() while waiting for a transition to be active
#         ...
#         state1 = myMachine.add_state(state1_logic)
#         ...
#
#  3. Transition - This class is used to store a function that will
#     execute and return a boolean value of True or False. If it evaluates
#     to True, the state will use the transition's to_state_number to
#     tell the machine what the next state should be.
#
#
#         def state1_force_transition_to_2():
#             if some_condition == True:
#                 return True             #<---- Transition when some_condition is True
#             else:
#                 return False
#
# 
#         state1.attach_transition(state1_force_transition_to_2, state2)   #<---- Attach state1 transition to state2, when some_condition == True
#
#
#  4. Forced transitions
#     An alternative way to specify the transitions without creating
#     transition objects is to use the state machine's force_transition_to()
#     method. This method will force the transition to another state,
#     bypassing any transitions attached to a particular state. This
#     approach also has the benefit of not requiring the creation of
#     transition objects, and the code could be leaner. One way of
#     using this feature is to use it inside the state logic as
#     in the example below:
# 
#         def state1_logic():
#             global counter
#             
#             if myMachine.execute_once:
#                 myTimer.start()
#                 counter += 1
#                 print("State 1 Logic: Blinking LED")
# 
#             if myTimer.finished():
#                 myMachine.force_transition_to(state2)   #<---- If timer has finished force transition to state2
